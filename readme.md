this tuesday's assignment was over making an operating clockand and a #hex color bow that changes color on the second tick. Getting started is always pretty hard for me, but once I get my wheels rolling I start to feel pretty good about everything. styling the clock in css was no problem it was more so the javascript part for me when it came to setting my variables up correctly and making sure they were being called right. Functions still get me bent out of shape. Even though this assignment took way longer than expected, I can now say I understand functions a tiny bit more due to all my trials and errors. I still have a long way to go to grasp the functions concept how I want to.
